letterbolt
==========

Letterbolt is a single JS file (letters.js) which add an animated font to your webpage.
Just add the 'lb' class to your html tag and the font will be implemented on the writing.
<code>
	<h2 class='lb giant scrolled'> some writing </h2>
</code>

there are different size and animation and you can choose it with the css classes.
The default size is a medium one, if you want to change use theese classes:

- small
- big
- giant

there are 2 kind of animation, a looped one (each 8 seconds) and a scrolled one (proportional to the vertical scroll position).
Theese are the classes to use:

- looped
- scrolled

You can choose different colors, sizes, timing,... but at the moment, to do that, you should work directly on the JS file.
